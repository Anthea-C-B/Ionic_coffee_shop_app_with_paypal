    <h1>About Coffee:</h1>
    <p>
      Coffee is brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of
      berries from the Coffea plant. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically
      having its origin in Ethipia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Reunion 
      in the Indian Ocean. The plant was exportedt from Africa to countries around the world and 
      coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countires, primarily in the equatorial regions
      of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly
      regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. Once ripe, coffee 
      berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to 
      varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are gorund and brewed with
      near-boiling water to produce as a beverage.
